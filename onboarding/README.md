# Member Onboarding Guide

Welcome to our Discord server! We're thrilled to have you join our community. To unlock the full experience and access more parts of the server, we ask that you complete the member onboarding process. This involves providing some personal data, which helps us tailor your experience and ensure a safe and engaging environment for everyone.

## Why Complete Onboarding?

Completing the onboarding process not only grants you access to additional server features but also allows you to actively participate in discussions, events, and activities. While it's optional, incomplete onboarding results in limited access to the server, with read-only privileges.

## What Information is Collected?

When you complete onboarding, the following information is stored securely in our database:

- **Discord ID:** Your unique identifier on Discord.
- **Nickname:** The name you choose to display in the server.
- **Server Join Date:** The date you joined our community.
- **Server Access Level:** Information about your permissions within the server.

## Agreement to Server Rules

By completing the onboarding process, you agree to abide by the rules and guidelines set forth in our Discord server. These rules are in place to ensure a respectful and inclusive environment for all members.

## Privacy and Data Usage

We take your privacy seriously. Any data provided during the onboarding process is handled in accordance with our privacy policy. By completing onboarding, you consent to:

- **Public Visibility:** Your posts and comments may be made publicly visible not only within the Discord server but also on our website, social media platforms, blog, and other related channels.
- **Data Storage:** Your inputted information will be stored securely by our server for administrative and community management purposes.
